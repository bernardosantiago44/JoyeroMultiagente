# GridRenderer Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolution: "Renderizado mínimo del grid"

### Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **✅ Grid visualization in SceneView**: 
   - Implemented with Unity Gizmos in `OnDrawGizmos()`
   - Color-coded cell types differentiation
   - Grid lines for clear boundaries

2. **✅ Preview mode without GridService**:
   - Configurable preview dimensions (`_previewWidth`, `_previewHeight`) 
   - Works standalone for initial testing and setup
   - Shows basic grid structure with empty cells

3. **✅ No circular dependencies**:
   - Uses `ServiceRegistry.TryResolve<GridService>()` pattern
   - Never creates or manages GridService lifecycle
   - Safe fallback to preview mode when service unavailable

### Key Implementation Features

**Core Functionality:**
- `GridRenderer` MonoBehaviour component for Unity integration
- Dual-mode operation: preview vs. GridService-connected
- Real-time visualization of grid state changes
- Inspector controls for all visual settings

**Visual Features:**
- **Cell Types**: Empty (gray), Wall (brown), Shelf (tan), Jewel (gold), Zone (green), RobotSpawn (blue)
- **Occupancy Display**: Robot (red sphere), Jewel (yellow wire), Zone (green wire), Reserved (magenta wire)  
- **Grid Lines**: Clear cell boundary visualization
- **Customizable Colors**: All colors configurable via Inspector

**Technical Features:**
- Zero performance impact on gameplay (Gizmos only in SceneView)
- Proper Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle management
- Context menu for manual GridService reconnection
- Extensible design with `_useTileMode` toggle for future tile-based rendering

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`Assets/Scripts/Grid/GridRenderer.cs`** (209 lines)
   - Main implementation with full feature set
   - Complete XML documentation following project standards

2. **`Assets/Scripts/Debug/GridRendererDemo.cs`** (162 lines)  
   - Demonstration script with sample grid patterns
   - Shows all cell types and occupancy scenarios

3. **`Assets/Scripts/Debug/GridRendererVerification.cs`** (185 lines)
   - Automated verification of all acceptance criteria
   - Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

4. **`Assets/Scripts/Systems/QATestingSystem.cs`**
   - Added `TestGridRenderer()` method
   - Integrated with existing test framework

5. **`Assets/Scripts/Grid/GridRenderer_Usage.md`**
   - Complete usage documentation
   - Setup instructions and troubleshooting guide

### Testing & Quality Assurance

**Automated Tests Added:**
- GridRenderer component creation
- Preview mode functionality  
- GridService integration
- Color configuration validation
- Occupancy visualization capability
- No circular dependencies verification

**Manual Testing Support:**
- `GridRendererDemo` for visual testing
- `GridRendererVerification` for automated validation
- Context menu options for runtime testing

### Architecture Integration

**Follows Project Patterns:**
- Uses `ServiceRegistry` for dependency injection
- Implements standard Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle
- Follows C# documentation standards with XML comments
- Integrates with existing `GridService`, `GridMap`, `GridCell` architecture

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Pure additive implementation
- No modifications to existing core classes
- Backward compatible with current grid system

### Performance & Reliability

- **Zero Runtime Cost**: Gizmos only render in SceneView/Editor
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works without GridService available
- **Memory Efficient**: No persistent rendering objects created
- **Exception Safe**: Handles missing services gracefully

## Summary

The GridRenderer successfully provides minimal grid visualization that meets all specified requirements:
- ✅ Displays grid with differentiated cell types using colors
- ✅ Works in preview mode without GridService dependency  
- ✅ Avoids circular dependencies through safe service resolution
- ✅ Provides optional tile mode toggle for future extensibility

The implementation is production-ready, well-tested, and fully documented.
